## Synthesizing Forestry Images Conditioned on Plant Phenological Attribute Using a Generative Adversarial Network

#### Abstract:

This work generates synthetic forestry images satisfying certain phenological attributes. Here, we consider the greenness index of plants which is a phenological attribute describing a particular vegetation type in a mixed forest. In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been found to be promising in synthesizing realistic images in the field of Computer Vision. Our objective is to exploit the concept of Conditional GAN to generate synthetic forestry images conditioned on the greenness of vegetation canopy. The training data is based on the automated digital camera imagery provided by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and processed by the PhenoCam Network. The synthetic images generated by our method are also used to predict another phenological attribute, viz., redness of plants. The Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index is utilized to assess the quality of the synthetic images. The greenness and redness indices of the generated synthetic images are compared against that of the original images using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in order to evaluate their accuracy and integrity. Moreover, the generalizability and scalability of our proposed GAN model is determined by effectivelytransforming it to generate synthetic images for other forest sites and vegetation types.
